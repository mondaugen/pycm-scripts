Questions:

Should the forms of multiple parameters be coupled?

Are there timing issues in SC?

What other ways can pitches be chosen?

How do you "fill-in" like in real music, like chords with arpeggios etc.?

TODO:

Implement polyphony and more instruments.

The pitch selection of chords is not as good as before because it is not
choosing successive subsets of pitches.

Friday March 29th:

Coupling means that they use the same form

Try generating forms where all the parameters are totally coupled:
    1 voice
    ...
    n voices

Make a script where you can choose what parameters are coupled.

Make a "timbremaker" that can vary the timbres of the voices.
